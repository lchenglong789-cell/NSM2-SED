# Notice
1. For better understanding of SED community, our codes are developed based on the [baseline codes](https://github.com/DCASE-REPO/DESED_task/tree/master/recipes/dcase2023_task4_baseline) of [DCASE2023 challenge task 4](https://dcase.community/). Therefore, the training progress is build under [`pytorch-lightning`](https://lightning.ai/).

# Get started
1. To reproduce our experiments, please first ensure you have the full DESED 2023 dataset.
2. Ensure you have the correct environment. The environment of this code is the same as the DCASE 2023 baseline, please refer to their [docs/codes](https://github.com/DCASE-REPO/DESED_task/tree/master/recipes/dcase2023_task4_baseline) to configure your environment.
3.  Clone the NSM2-SED codes by:

```
git clone https://github.com/lchenglong789-cell/NSM2-SED.git
```

4. Install our desed_task package by:

```
cd NSM2-SED
```

```
pip install -e .
```
