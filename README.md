Notice
Strong val dataset: This dataset meta files are now updated to the repo.

For better understanding of SED community, our codes are developed based on the baseline codes of DCASE2022 challenge task 4. Therefore, the training progress is build under pytorch-lightning.

We report both DESED development set results. The external set is the extra data extracted from the AudioSet/AudioSetStrong. Please do not mess it with the 3000+ strongly labelled real audio clips from the AudioSet.
